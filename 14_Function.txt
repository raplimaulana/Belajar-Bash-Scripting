*In a Bash script on Linux, $? is a special variable that stores the exit status of the last command that was executed.

 Exit Status: A command in Linux returns an exit status, which is a number that indicates whether the command was successful or if it encountered an error.
 An exit status of 0 typically means the command was successful.
 Any non-zero value indicates an error or some issue.
